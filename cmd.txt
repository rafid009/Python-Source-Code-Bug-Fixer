screen -dm bash -c 'script -c "python muzero.py" output.txt'

This will run the project in a different screen and wirte the console output to output.txt. If you want to get back the console run

screen -r

Otherwise, If you want to just run it in a console without screen, do the following

python muzero.py

Currently, it will train on only 100 train data and run evaluation on another 100 from test data.
